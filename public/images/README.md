# Introduction

## The Project
**NabShop** is an ecommerce website that allows people to purchase books. A user without an account can browse the catalogue of books available in the store, see the prices, view details of each book including the description and so on. They can search for a particular book by typing in the search bar in the navigation menu. While still not having registered to the website, they can add books in their cart, see what's in their cart, and when they are ready to make a purchase, they will prompted to open an account, fill in payment details and place the orther.
The user that has an account can view their account details, their past orders.

## The Context
A webstack portfolio project is a requirement for completing the advanced curicullum of the ALX SE program. Having an affinity with literature and having published a few books, I decided to use the skills learned in the ALX SE program to build an ecommerce website to sell those books. We were able to choose our project partners and project topic, as long as we present a working program at the end of the three weeks of development. I worked on this project alone as it is about someting personal and also I wanted to touch the backend and the frontend.

<!-- ## Story behind ARC
Since COVID-19, it has proven necessary to not only have in person  healthcare assistance services but also virtual health care services. With a healthcare website that intends to bridge the gap between time and a user's needs, lives could be saved and better.
Oftentimes when people get sick (nothing too serious but still need to see a doctor), they encounter several challenges trying to get treated as soon as possible. The hospital could be far away from them in the city, there could be a long queue there… This is why we wanted to build **“ARC”** (African Rapid Care).
We aim to use technology to propose sustainable solutions to the problems we face daily in the different aspects of our  lives, the health domain being one of the most important ones. We ceased this opportunity to propose something that has the potential of saving people's lives. -->
